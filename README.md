# $olitary-exploits
a few exploits i made for a game called $olitary on roblox


# Script 1
the first script is a script that adds a gui that allows you to:
1. change the ride height of your car

2. add "hydraulics" like in a low rider

there are a few problems with it but nothing that will stop it from working. 
if your wheels get stuck up or down while in hydraulic mode just press 7 and 8 at the same time.
i recommend any number from 2 to 7 as any lower or higher may break your car but you can experiment as it is different for all of the cars.
you need to spawn in your car before executing the script and if you despawn it press the x and execute again after you spawn your new car.

# Script 2
this script is a script that automatically changes the color of your car
you can change how many colors the car has (you need to look in the customisation menu and see how many there are)
the key bind is C

# Script 3
the final script is a rgb under glow
i suggest you don’t change any of the settings on this one as they are okay right now but you can change the default key bind.
the key bind is F
